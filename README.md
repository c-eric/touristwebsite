# Tourist Website
### The goal of this project was to create an unofficial single-page application of a tourist location in Canada.

It contains the following features:
* Google Maps API: Displays a Google Map with a marker and provides directions.
* Language Toggle: Supports both French and English versions of the website, with the ability to switch languages from the navigation bar.
* Image and Map Reveal: Dynamically reveals images and the map based on the user's scroll position.
* Form Submission: Allows users to submit ticket order requests through a form, with the data being sent to a [Google Sheets spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/163hiD6Z7Nq4uexeebTriCCEGAV-GFI81sjTNd9dQ_-I/edit).
* Smooth Scrolling: Implements smooth scrolling behavior when clicking on navigation links.
* Responsiveness: The website is designed to be responsive, adapting its layout and content to different screen sizes and devices.
